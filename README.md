Welcome to our game!

Run! is a platform-based game that takes left, right, and jump commands to make the character run around the map. The goal is to get to the end of the level before being caught by the deadly ray beam. To begin, click start and use the arrow keys and space bar to start moving. Careful not to hit the spikes!

The game uses the packages PYGAME and SYS to run efficiently. To create our sprites and game map, we used PIXELART.COM. The entire game map was pieced together using TILED. All coding was done in VISUAL STUDIO CODE using PYTHON, and all progress was saved in GITHUB.
